The entire UI is design around cards, which are supposed to emulate pages in a lab notebook. You can add, remove, or edit cards as you please. \nExplore our platform (and business model) using the cards below.  If you accidentally delete something, don't worry, just refresh the page!"

They are too expensive to purchase in bulk, too complex to use as a tool (rather its own lesson) and too fragile to be used by students."
